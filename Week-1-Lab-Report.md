## Part 3: Remotely Connecting

---------------------------------------------------------

1. If you are on Windows, download and install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) onto your computer.

<br/>

2. Open the terminal in VScode (Under *Terminal* in the upper bar), then open the command palette (Under *View* in the upper bar). Search "Select
default profile" in the command palette, and then select Git Bash.
> You should see something similar to the screen below

<br/>

3. Go the terminal and click on the plus sign in the upper right corner. This should open a drop down menu. Select Git Bash, and a new Git Bash terminal will
be created.

<br/>

4. Type the following template into the Git Bash terminal: `$ ssh ____________@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where the blank spaces should be filled with
your cse15L account username. 
> Ex: `$ ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

> Another Note: You should see the that the terminal already has `$`, and you don't type it in yourself.
