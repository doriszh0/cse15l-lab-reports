## Part 1: Installing VScode (Visual Studio Code)
> Note: Skip this if you already have VScode installed.

---------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) onto your computer, and open up VScode.
> Make sure to select the correct version depending on your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac)

> You should see something similar to the screen below after opening VScode
>

## Part 2: Remotely Connecting

---------------------------------------------------------

1. If you are on Windows, download and install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) onto your computer.

<br/>

2. Open the terminal in VScode (Under *Terminal* in the upper bar), then open the command palette (Under *View* in the upper bar). Search "Select
default profile" in the command palette, and then select Git Bash.
> You should see something similar to the screen below
>

<br/>

3. Go the terminal and click on the plus sign in the upper right corner. This should open a drop down menu. Select Git Bash, and a new Git Bash terminal will
be created.

<br/>

4. Type the following template into the Git Bash terminal: `$ ssh ____________@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where the blank spaces should be filled with
your cse15L account username. 
> Ex: `$ ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

> Note: You should see the that the terminal already has `$`, and you don't type it in yourself. 

<br/>

5. If this is the first time you are connecting to this server, the terminal will then output a message about authenticity and ask you: `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`. Type in `yes`. 
> Note: Skip this if this is not your first time.

<br/>

6. You will then have to enter your password to your cse15L account next to where it says `Password:`.
> Note: If you just changed the password, it may take a while (maybe even up to an hour) for the password change to take effect.

> Another Note: When you type in your password, nothing will show up on the screen, but the characters are still being registered (hidden due to privacy).

<br/>

7. You are now connected to the remote server, and should see a message like `Hello _________, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu`, where the blank space is your cse15L account username. There should also be some other statuses and user information displayed.

<br/>
<br/>

## Part 3: Trying Some Commands 

---------------------------------------------------------

1. Try out this series of commands in the Git Bash terminal:

> Run the command `cd \home`, which should open the absolute path `\home`.

> Run the command `ls -a` to look at all the files, including hidden ones, in the current directory.

> Run the command `cd ~` to return to your user directory. Then run the command `cd ..` to go to the parent directory for it.

> Run the command `cat public/hello.txt` to go to the relative path `public/hello.txt` and output the text in the file `hello.txt`.

<br/>

> Note: If there are any issues, refer to the image below, which shows the commands being run.
